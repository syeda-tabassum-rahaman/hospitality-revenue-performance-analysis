# 🏨 Hospitality Revenue & Performance Analysis

### 📋 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive data-driven solution for the hospitality industry to optimize revenue and booking performance. By analyzing historical datasets from a hotel chain, it identifies key growth opportunities and provides actionable insights to improve room occupancy and strategic pricing.

### 🎯 Business Value
* **Revenue Optimization:** Analyzes RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) and ADR (Average Daily Rate) to maximize profitability.
* **Occupancy Management:** Identifies booking patterns across different cities and room categories to optimize inventory.
* **Platform Performance:** Evaluates realization rates across various booking channels (Direct vs. Third-party) to help reduce commission costs.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Hospitality KPI Engine:** Automated calculation of core industry metrics: RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy %.
* **Data Reliability Layer:** Custom Python scripts to handle "dirty data," including pricing outliers and invalid guest entries.
* **Geographic Analytics:** Deep-dive performance analysis across major urban hubs to guide regional marketing spend.
* **Realization Tracking:** Analysis of the gap between successful bookings and actual check-ins to improve forecasting.
