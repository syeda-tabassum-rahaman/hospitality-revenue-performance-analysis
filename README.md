# 🏨 Hospitality Revenue & Booking Intelligence

### 📋 Project Overview
This project provides a data-driven solution for the hospitality industry to optimize hotel revenue and booking performance. By analyzing historical booking data from a hotel chain (AtliQ Hotels), it identifies key growth opportunities and provides actionable insights to improve room occupancy and pricing strategies.

### 🎯 Business Value
* **Revenue Management:** Analyzes RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) and ADR (Average Daily Rate) to maximize profitability.
* **Occupancy Growth:** Identifies booking patterns across different cities and room categories to fill "dead zones."
* **Platform Optimization:** Evaluates which booking channels (Direct vs. Third-party) provide the highest realization rate, helping to reduce commission costs.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Hospitality KPI Dashboard:** Automated calculation of essential metrics: RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy %.
* **Data Reliability Layer:** Custom Python scripts to handle "dirty data" such as outlier pricing and invalid guest entries.
* **City-Level Analytics:** Deep-dive analysis into performance trends across major hubs (Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore).
* **Segmented Insights:** Breakdown of performance by room class (Elite, Premium, Standard) to guide marketing spend.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Libraries:** Pandas (Processing), Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
* **Analysis Type:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Business Intelligence (BI)
* **Logic:** Built with a "Business-First" mindset, focusing on metrics that drive executive decisions.

### 📊 Key Insights from the Analysis
* **Lead Time Impact:** Understanding how early bookings correlate with cancellation rates.
* **Revenue Leakage:** Identifying the gap between "Booked" and "Realized" revenue to improve forecasting.
* **Pricing Elasticity:** Analysis of how ADR changes during weekends vs. weekdays in different city markets.
